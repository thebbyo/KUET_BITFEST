**Cheeseburger Recipe**
**Ingredients:**
**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Beef Patties:**
   - Divide the ground beef into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. **Preheat the Grill:**
   - Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with a little oil or butter to prevent sticking.
3. **Cook the Patties:**
   - Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side until the bottom is well seared. Flip the patties and place a slice of cheese on top.
4. **Melt the Cheese:**
   - Cover the grill or skillet with a lid to help the cheese melt. Cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare or longer if you prefer well-done.
5. **Prepare the Buns:**
   - Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in the oven until golden brown.
6. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - Spread ketchup and mustard on the bottom buns. Place the lettuce, tomato slices, and pickles on top. Add the burger patty with melted cheese. Top with the other half of the bun.
7. **Serve:**
   - Serve immediately with fries or your favorite side dish.
Enjoy your delicious homemade cheeseburgers!
